README v .7071

This is an in-progress plugin for Wordpress. Adding it to your site impliments some features that merge TEI Boilerplate, a tool written to easily display TEI documents, with Wordpress, allowing you to integrate a file into a post. NOTE: If you are using a Wordpress.com site, you cannot install plugins (unless you are a VIP user).

== Directions ==

Managing Files
After uploading it to your site and enabling it (through the plugins menu), an option should now be visible on the Dashboard in the Plugins tab called "TEI + WP". It should be right below the Editor option. Clicking on this will take you to the plugin's admin page. Here you can see all the documents that are currently on the server. You can upload and delete files from this page.

Integrating a File into a Post
There are currently two ways to integrate a TEI file into a post.
1) Upload your file through the TEI + WP plugin admin page. Remember the name of this file, and try naming it something short yet identifiable. Avoid spaces in the name. For instance, one of the files I uploaded is called red-diary.xml, and is a transcript of Thomas Merton's Red Diary. Once you've uploaded a file, start writing a new post. When you want to display your file, write the command:

     @teipluswp:red-diary.xml

Substitute your file's name into the last bit. When you view your page, it should display an iframe containing your file.
2) The second method for integrating a TEI file into a post is directly copying and pasting the text from your document. Say I have some string <TEI>stringstringstring</TEI>. To upload this, I would write the following post:

     Hey! This is a nifty TEI document.
     @teipluswp:beginxml<tei-string>
     <TEI>stringstringstring</TEI>
     @teipluswp:endxml

How does this display your document? Firstly, when you go to view your page, a php snippet recognizes the tags @teibeginxml<name> and @teiendxml, and writes the string <TEI>stringstringstring</TEI> to a file called "tei-string.xml". This is stored locally, and if you go to the admin page you will see the file "tei-string.xml" and you can delete it. Hence, after viewing your page, you could go back and change your string to @teipluswp:tei-string.xml and have the same effect (with much less text clogging up your post).

Anyways, hope it works alright. It's still a work in progress. E-mail me at b.k.bolte@emory.edu with suggestions.
